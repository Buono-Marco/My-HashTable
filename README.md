# My-HashTable
Exercise 10.3 from Eck, D. J. (2019). Introduction to programming using Java, version 8.1. Hobart and William Smith Colleges. http://math.hws.edu/javanotes

he fact that Java has a HashMap class means that no Java programmer has to write an implementation of hash tables from scratchâ€”unless, of course, that programmer is a computer science student.

For this exercise, you should write a hash table in which both the keys and the values are of type String. (This is not an exercise in generic programming; do not try to write a generic class.) Write an implementation of hash tables from scratch. Define the following methods: get(key), put(key,value), remove(key), containsKey(key), and size(). Remember that every object, obj, has a method obj.hashCode() that can be used for computing a hash code for the object, so at least you don't have to define your own hash function. Do not use any of Java's built-in generic types; create your own linked lists using nodes as covered in Subsection 9.2.2. However, you are not required to increase the size of the table when it becomes too full.

9.2.2  Linked Lists
class Node {
   String item;
   Node next;
}
